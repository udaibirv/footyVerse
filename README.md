# FootyVerse

FootyVerse is a web application for fans of the beautiful game to see updated facts and figures of the top 5 leagues in Europe. The countries from which the featured leagues are from include England, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. In order to acess the necesarry data for this application, the information I gathered was from an API called "api-football". Upon logging into the application, the user is able to pick one of the 5 leagues and see the league table from the last 5 seasons, as well as the top scorers for that league, also for the last 5 seasons. Since 2010, I have been enamoured with the sport of football, and it has completely taken over my life. Despite at times having to wake up at 5am to tune in for a Chelsea match, the love I have for the game grows each and every year. This project allowed me to build upon and improve my skills with React and the different ways to implement data fron API's while also creating something that fans of football would find useful in an application.

## What I learned 
  1) I learned that it is vital to test out the response I get from an external API, as the response samples can differ from each endpoint
  2) How to effecitvely utilize a nested map method when the response was an array of objects, with more arrays
